🔱 Our spearhead project is [bpmn-visualization](https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-js/), a TypeScript library for visualizing process execution data on [BPMN diagrams](https://www.bpmn.org/). It comes with its companion [examples](https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-examples/) repository.

⚗️ 🔬  🤖 R users will be interested in [bpmn-visualization-R](https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-R/), the R package for visualizing process execution data on BPMN diagrams, using overlays, style customization and interactions.
